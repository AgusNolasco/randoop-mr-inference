  - Add enter/exit method to the branch coverage data.  would this
    be hard?  Could we then output which methods were at least
    called

      Carlos thinks this will take a couple of days.  Covertura would
      be much faster.

  - What about checking public fields?  

      Carlos thinks this will be reasonable.

  - What variables does it make sense to use for observers?  I don't
    want to duplicate tests.

    A reasonable set of variables would be the one returned from
    the last call and all of the arguments to the last call.

  - Can we eliminate tests that don't add code coverage?

  - Add SecurityManager

  - Timing information.

  - RegressionCaptureVisitor

    Adds the Observations to the decorations.  I'll need to create new
    types of Observations and that is where printing is implemented.

  - Questions for ABB

    -- Do they have different versions of the code that we could try
       this on?

    -- Do they have any properties (like equals should be reflexive)
       that we could check.

Various issues:

  - Need a stack trace when a class can't be initialized.  I changed
    it to include that.  Without the trace, its pretty hard to figure
    out what happened.

  - Might want to warn rather than dieing when a class can't be created.
    Obviously, the user can remove the classes, but it might be nice
    to continue

  - Run tests in a security manager that is safe by default (and can be
    extended by the user as need be)

  -

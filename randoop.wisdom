% Randoop command line options
%
To remove certain constructors/methods use --omitfilter.  It specifies
a pattern that must match java.reflection.Method.toString() of the
constructor/method.  The implementation is in 
randoop.util.DefaultReflectionFilter

To create an object for randoop using particular code, create a helper
class that constructs it the way you want and then add that class to
the list of classes to explore.

Most command line options are specified in GenInputsAbstract.java

%
% Where things are implemented
%
output capture is implemented in ExecutableSequence.executeStatement.
This is accomplished by changing stdout and stderr to a memory
based printsteam and recording the results.

comparing observations to see if they return consistent results is
implementedin ExecutableSequence.compare_observations()
